One of my key contributions was leading the trend analysis and defining extreme weather events in a systematic way. To ensure a consistent methodology, we selected 2006–2016 as the baseline period, allowing us to identify extreme events based on the 95th percentile threshold for heatwaves, precipitation, and wind speed, as well as the 5th percentile threshold for cold days. This approach provided a statistically grounded framework for detecting significant climate anomalies. The trend analysis revealed a substantial rise in heatwave occurrences, projected to increase at least 4.4 times by 2080, while extreme precipitation and wind events showed a relatively stable trend.
A major challenge we faced was defining event thresholds that could adapt across different climate scenarios. Initially, the selection process was arbitrary, which led to inconsistencies in event classification. Additionally, understanding the correlation between climate variables required careful consideration of lag effects and multivariate interactions, as extreme weather events are influenced by multiple factors over time.
To address these challenges, we refined our methodology through literature review and percentile-based thresholding, ensuring a more data-driven approach. Selecting 2006–2016 as the reference period was a critical decision, as it allowed us to compare future trends relative to a stable climate baseline. Furthermore, statistical techniques such as point-biserial correlation helped uncover key relationships between solar radiation, humidity, and extreme temperature events, providing deeper insights into heatwave formation.
Through this project, I developed strong skills in climate data analysis, statistical modeling, and trend forecasting. Working with large-scale climate projection datasets improved my ability to process and interpret complex data, while collaboration with my team enhanced my scientific communication and problem-solving skills. Most importantly, I gained a deeper understanding of how extreme weather events evolve over time and the critical role of baseline selection in climate studies. This experience also sparked my interest in exploring machine learning for predictive climate modeling, which I hope to pursue further in future research.

In this group project, I was responsible for conducting the background research and performing the correlation analysis. Throughout the process, I encountered several challenges and learning opportunities that significantly enhanced my analytical skills and understanding of statistical methods.
Initially, my group members suggested using the t-test for hypothesis testing. However, after conducting a thorough investigation, I found that t-tests are more suitable for small sample sizes (typically n < 30). Given that our dataset contained a much larger number of observations, I decided to replace the t-test with the z-test, which is more appropriate for large sample sizes as it assumes a normal distribution of the population. This adjustment ensured that our analysis was statistically sound and aligned with best practices for large datasets.
Another major challenge I faced was finding effective visualization techniques to represent the relationships between different meteorological variables and extreme weather events. Since our dataset contained both continuous variables (e.g., humidity, wind speed) and binary variables (e.g., extreme events: yes/no), standard scatter plots were not always the best option. I explored various approaches, including violin plots, box plots, and bar charts, to effectively illustrate differences in distributions between extreme and normal weather conditions. This process deepened my understanding of data visualization and reinforced the importance of choosing appropriate visual representation methods.
When performing correlation analysis, I initially considered using the point-biserial correlation since the extreme events column was a binary variable (0 = normal, 1 = extreme). During our presentation, our professor questioned this choice and pointed out that the variables in our dataset do not exhibit strictly linear relationships, making point-biserial correlation (which behaves similarly to Pearson correlation) an unsuitable choice. After reviewing the feedback, I realized that a Spearman correlation would be more appropriate, as it is better suited for analyzing non-linear relationships and rank-based associations. This insight helped deepen my understanding of how to effectively apply correlation analysis and select appropriate methods based on data characteristics.
Through this project, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and critical thinking in research and data analysis. I realized that effective communication and collaboration are crucial when working in a team, as different perspectives often lead to more well-rounded conclusions. Additionally, I learned the value of flexibility in problem-solving—sometimes initial approaches may not work as expected, and being open to adjustments is essential for improving the quality of analysis. Lastly, this experience reinforced the importance of lifelong learning, as working with data often requires continuously refining skills, exploring new methodologies, and seeking expert feedback to enhance the accuracy and credibility of findings.

This data science project provided a valuable introduction to environmental and climate science, a field outside my usual area of expertise. 
Beyond strengthening my data visualization skills and solidifying my understanding of statistical concepts like correlation types, the project gave me my first hands-on experience working with climate projection data. While climate science is a vast field, this project offered a fascinating glimpse into the types of analysis and work possible with this data.
The presentation itself was an excellent opportunity to practice my public speaking skills, particularly in a non-native language.
There's certainly room for improvement. Specifically, we could have benefited from a deeper understanding of the core concepts discussed in the presentation and how different events are interpreted.
While we relied on existing literature, our lack of foundational knowledge regarding heat waves, heat stress, and extreme weather events likely led to some inaccuracies in our use of climate-related vocabulary during the presentation of our results.
Regarding our workflow, while we used a GitHub repository, none of the team members were proficient in collaborative version control on a single file. 
Due to time constraints, we didn't have the opportunity to learn this, so we resorted to working on the code locally and then manually integrating everyone's contributions. This is an area we should focus on improving in future projects.
