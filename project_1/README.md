### **Usage Notes**
1. **Weight Calculation**:  
   Total Score = Î£ (Criterion Score Ã— Weight).  
   Example:  
   - Background (10%): Score Ã— 0.1  
   - Problem Design (15%): Score Ã— 0.15

2. **Grade Boundaries**:  
   - **High Distinction**: Exceeds in depth, innovation, and rigor.  
   - **Distinction**: Meets core requirements with minor gaps.  
   - **Merit**: Basic standards met.  
   - **Pass**: Minimum requirements with flaws.  
   - **Fail**: Critical criteria unmet.
